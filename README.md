# Reproducibility-Study-Connectivity-Preserving-Multi-Agent-Flocking
I'm presenting my reproducibility track project on connectivity-preserving flocking. I'll be reproducing a seminal 2009 IEEE paper by Zavlanos and colleagues that solves a critical problem in multi-agent systems - how to maintain network connectivity while achieving coordinated motion.
